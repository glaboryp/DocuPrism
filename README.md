## 🎯 The Problem

In the age of AI, powerful language models have become essential for productivity. However, they come with significant drawbacks:
* **Connectivity Dependence:** They are useless without a stable internet connection.
* **Privacy Risks:** Users must upload potentially sensitive or proprietary documents to third-party servers.
* **Cost:** API calls and server infrastructure can be expensive for developers and, ultimately, for users.

## ✨ The Solution: DocuPrism

**DocuPrism** solves these problems by leveraging Google Chrome's new built-in, on-device AI. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings powerful document analysis capabilities directly into your browser, ensuring your data never leaves your machine.

It's fast, secure, and works anytime, anywhere—even on a plane.

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Running Locally)

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**
* Node.js (LTS version)
* `pnpm` package manager
* A compatible version of Google Chrome that supports the Built-in AI APIs.

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/glaboryp/DocuPrism.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd DocuPrism
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Enabling Chrome Built-in AI:**

To use DocuPrism, you need to enable Chrome's Built-in AI features:

1. **Download Chrome Canary or Dev Channel**
   - [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) (Recommended)
   - [Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/)

2. **Enable Required Flags**
   - Navigate to `chrome://flags`
   - Search for and enable the following flags:
     - `#optimization-guide-on-device-model` → **Enabled BypassPerfRequirement**
     - `#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` → **Enabled**
     - `#summarization-api-for-gemini-nano` → **Enabled**
     - `#language-detection-api` → **Enabled**
   - Restart Chrome

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Open DevTools Console
   - Type: `await ai.summarizer.capabilities()`
   - Should return: `{available: "readily"}`

4. **Download AI Model (if needed)**
   - The first time you use the app, Chrome may need to download the Gemini Nano model
   - This happens automatically when you click "Summarize"
   - Model size: ~1.5GB (one-time download)

**Available Scripts:**

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev          # Start development server

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run unit tests (19 tests)
