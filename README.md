## üéØ The Problem

In the age of AI, powerful language models have become essential for productivity. However, they come with significant drawbacks:
* **Connectivity Dependence:** They are useless without a stable internet connection.
* **Privacy Risks:** Users must upload potentially sensitive or proprietary documents to third-party servers.
* **Cost:** API calls and server infrastructure can be expensive for developers and, ultimately, for users.

## ‚ú® The Solution: DocuPrism

**DocuPrism** solves these problems by leveraging Google Chrome's new built-in, on-device AI. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings powerful document analysis capabilities directly into your browser, ensuring your data never leaves your machine.
